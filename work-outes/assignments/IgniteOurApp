1. What is NPM?

   - npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every cntinent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.
   - npm use to
     - Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
     - Download standalone tools you can use right away.
     - Run packages withour downloading using npx.
     - Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
     - Restrict code to specific developers.
     - Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
     - Form virtual teams by using organizations.
     - Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
     - Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
     - Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
     - Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

   - Parcel and webpack are the bundlers used mostly for JavaScript or Typescript code that helps you to minify, clean, and make your code compact so that it becomes easier to send a request or receive the response from the server when it usually takes you to transfer multiple files without using any budler for loading the page of your application.

3. What is `.parcel-cache`

   - cache folder(or .parcel-cache in parcel v2) stores infromation about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.

4. What is npx ?

   - NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.0 and above.

5. What is the difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`

   - Dependencies are the packages that are required for your application to run properly, devDependencies are the packages that are required for development and testing purposes only.

6. What is Tree Shaking?

   - Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the JavaScript context for dead-code elimination. It relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax, i.e. import and export. The name and concept have been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler rollup.

7. What is Hot Module Replacemant?

   - Hot Module Replacement is a feature that enables you to see code changes in the browser without having to refresh it, allowing you to preserve the state of your front-end application. But implementing HMR can be tricky because it can incur side effect.

8. List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.

   - Dev build
   - provides local server
   - HMR = Hot Module Replacement (Refresh the page automatically)
   - File Watching Algoritham - written in C++
   - Caching - Faster Builds

9. What is `.gitignore`?

   - gitignore file tells Git wheich files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository. gitignore is located in the root directory of your repo. The gitignore file itself is a plain text document.

10. What is the difference between `package.json` and `package.lock.json`?

    - json file is like a one-stop solution of your entire problem. package-lock. json is a file that is automatically generated by npm when a package is installed. It records the exact version of every installed dependency, including its sub-dependencies and their versions.

11. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json` ?

    - npm decides to update the package-lock. json file when you run an npm install . It does this to seemingly keep dependencies up-to-date without having to run npm update separately.

12. What is `node_modules` ? is it a good idea to push that on git?

    - Node_modules, a folder created by npm or yarn, contains all the packages installed locally from packages. json. This folder contains all the project downloaded dependencies. Reinstalling an existing package will not require a download from the Internet because node_modules also acts as a cache. It is not a good idea to push it on git, since it can be regenerated.

13. What is the `dist` folder?

    - The /dist stands for distributable. The /dist folder contains the minimized version of the source code. The code present in the /dist folder is actually the code which is used on production web applications.

14. What is `browserlists` ?
    - Browserslist can specify which browsers your web application can run in, it provides a configuration for specifying browsers range. Browserslist has become a standard in the industry, it is used by libraries such as Autoprefixer, Babel, ESLint, PostCSS, SWC and Webpack.
