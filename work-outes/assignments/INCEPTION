1. What is Emmet?
   Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. Also relying on Emmet's auto completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files.

2. Difference between a library and frame work
   A framework is a set of pre-written code that provides a structure for developing software applications. A library, on the other hand, is a collection of pre-written code that can be used to perform specific tasks.

3. what is CDN? why do we use it?
   A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network.
   The main use of a CDN is to deliver content through a network of servers in a secure and efficient way. These networks improve the content security, performance and availability. Other CDN use cases include collecting user analytics and tracking data on network traffic.

4. Why is React known as React?
   React is called React because it reacts. It was developed by Facebook (a site that CONSTANTLY updates their data) to improve the user interface development and more effectively change (REACT to) what the user sees when they're doing things like mouse clicking, submitting and typing.

5. What is cross-origin in the script tag?
   The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in. A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.

6. What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?
   The react package holds the react source for components, state, props and all the code that is react.
   The react-dom package as the name implies is the glue between React and the DOM. Often, you will only use it for one single thing: mounting your application to the index.html file with ReactDOM.render().

7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
   Development build runs the code as a Development environment and it is very slow. The production environment executes the code and is used by developers and QA people it Development, suppors
   -Generating Source Maps files for CSS, and helping developers to debug the code about original files.
   -Hot reloading enable to reload changes without restarting the server
   -Debugger available to debug the code in the browser console
   -It creates a single bundle.js file
   -Enable React Developer tools
   -React DevToolsProfiler

   Production build is for running the code on client browsers with more performance improvements.
   The production environment executes the code and is used by end users or customers
   -It has separate bundle files for app and vendor instead of a single bundle file
   -Minification and compression of javascript and HTML resources to reduce the size of the file.
   -Source Map can be disabled at runtime to reduce the size of the code
   -Also, Gzipping code to compress and reduce the size

8. What are async and defer?
   Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading.
